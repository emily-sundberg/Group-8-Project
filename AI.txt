Input:
I'm performing an analysis based on job postings by political geography. I have columns for Salary, State, Education level requirement, political affiliation of the state. How would you visualize this information using python?

Output
Excellent ‚Äî this is a rich dataset with both quantitative (salary) and categorical (state, education, political affiliation) variables. You can tell an interesting story with the right mix of summary, comparative, and geographic visualizations.

Below is a structured way to approach it, with example Python code (using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, optionally plotly for interactivity).

üß≠ 1. Overview of the Dataset

First, get a sense of the distributions:

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example setup
# df = pd.read_csv("job_postings.csv")

# Basic summary
print(df.describe())
print(df['STATE'].value_counts().head())
print(df['POLITICAL_AFFILIATION'].value_counts())

üí∞ 2. Salary Distribution by Political Affiliation

To see if ‚Äúred‚Äù vs ‚Äúblue‚Äù states differ in job pay levels:

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.boxplot(x="POLITICAL_AFFILIATION", y="SALARY", data=df, palette="coolwarm")
plt.title("Salary Distribution by Political Affiliation")
plt.xlabel("Political Affiliation")
plt.ylabel("Salary")
plt.show()


Insight goal: Compare median salaries and spread between groups.

Optionally use log(SALARY) if the distribution is skewed.

üéì 3. Education Requirement vs Salary

To check if certain education levels command higher pay within each political group:

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(
    x="MIN_EDULEVELS_NAME", 
    y="SALARY", 
    hue="POLITICAL_AFFILIATION",
    data=df, 
    estimator="median", 
    palette="Set2"
)
plt.title("Median Salary by Education Level and Political Affiliation")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()

üó∫Ô∏è 4. Geographic (State-Level) Comparison

You can visualize average salary by state, color-coded by political leaning.

# Compute state averages
state_avg = df.groupby(['STATE', 'POLITICAL_AFFILIATION'])['SALARY'].mean().reset_index()

plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.barplot(
    x="STATE",
    y="SALARY",
    hue="POLITICAL_AFFILIATION",
    data=state_avg,
    dodge=False,
    palette="coolwarm"
)
plt.title("Average Salary by State (Colored by Political Affiliation)")
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.show()


Or make it a choropleth map using Plotly:

import plotly.express as px

fig = px.choropleth(
    state_avg,
    locations='STATE',
    locationmode="USA-states",
    color='SALARY',
    scope="usa",
    hover_name='STATE',
    color_continuous_scale="Viridis",
    title="Average Salary by State"
)
fig.show()


Optionally overlay political affiliation by adjusting color or using facets.

üìä 5. Combined Interaction: Political Affiliation √ó Education √ó Salary

To capture multiple categorical dimensions:

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.catplot(
    x="MIN_EDULEVELS_NAME", 
    y="SALARY", 
    hue="POLITICAL_AFFILIATION",
    kind="box",
    data=df, 
    height=6, 
    aspect=1.5
)
plt.title("Salary Distribution by Education Level and Political Affiliation")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()

üß© 6. Optional: Regression/Effect Size Visualization

If you want to quantify differences:

sns.lmplot(
    x="MIN_EDULEVELS_NUMERIC",  # if you can encode levels numerically
    y="SALARY",
    hue="POLITICAL_AFFILIATION",
    data=df,
    markers=["o", "x"],
    palette="coolwarm"
)
plt.title("Education Level vs Salary by Political Affiliation")
plt.show()

üîÆ Bonus: Composite Dashboard (e.g., Plotly or Streamlit)

You can build an interactive dashboard with:

Dropdowns for filtering by state or education level

Linked plots showing salary distributions, counts, and geographic breakdowns

For example (Plotly Express):

import plotly.express as px

fig = px.box(
    df,
    x="POLITICAL_AFFILIATION",
    y="SALARY",
    color="MIN_EDULEVELS_NAME",
    points="all",
    title="Salary Distribution by Political Affiliation and Education Level"
)
fig.show()


Would you like me to tailor this visualization plan for static reporting (e.g., a paper or PDF) or for an interactive dashboard (Plotly/Streamlit/Quarto)? The structure would differ slightly.

ChatGPT said:

Excellent question ‚Äî and this is actually a very common problem in real labor market analytics:
‚ÄúHow do I find job postings that are AI-related when there isn‚Äôt a single binary column saying IS_AI_JOB = True?‚Äù

You can get there by filtering intelligently across the fields you do have.
Here‚Äôs how to do it systematically üëá

üß† Step 1: Define ‚ÄúAI job‚Äù

There‚Äôs no single definition, but AI-related postings typically fall into these categories:

Contain ‚ÄúAI‚Äù, ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù, ‚Äúmachine learning‚Äù, ‚Äúdeep learning‚Äù, ‚ÄúNLP‚Äù, ‚Äúdata science‚Äù, ‚Äúcomputer vision‚Äù, etc. in skill or occupation fields.

Belong to occupations like Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, AI Researcher, AI Product Manager, etc.

Require specialized tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Hugging Face, scikit-learn, OpenAI API, etc.

üßÆ Step 2: Search the right text columns

In your dataset, the most useful columns for detecting AI-related jobs are:

Column	Why it‚Äôs useful
SKILLS_NAME	Often lists keywords like ‚Äúmachine learning‚Äù, ‚Äúneural networks‚Äù, etc.
SPECIALIZED_SKILLS_NAME	Tends to contain domain-specific skills (good for AI detection).
COMMON_SKILLS_NAME	Broader skills like ‚Äúdata analysis‚Äù, sometimes includes AI phrases.
SOFTWARE_SKILLS_NAME	Can list ‚ÄúTensorFlow‚Äù, ‚ÄúPyTorch‚Äù, ‚ÄúKeras‚Äù, ‚ÄúOpenAI‚Äù, etc.
LOT_OCCUPATION_NAME / ONET_NAME	Often include titles like ‚ÄúData Scientist‚Äù, ‚ÄúAI Engineer‚Äù.
üß© Step 3: Build a PySpark filter

You can define a list of AI-related keywords, then filter rows where any relevant field contains one.

from pyspark.sql import functions as F

# List of keywords to search for
ai_keywords = [
    "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "deep learning",
    "neural network", "nlp", "natural language processing",
    "computer vision", "data science", "data scientist",
    "ai engineer", "ai research", "ml engineer",
    "tensorflow", "pytorch", "keras", "hugging face", "openai", "scikit-learn"
]

# Build regex pattern (case-insensitive)
pattern = "|".join([f"(?i){kw}" for kw in ai_keywords])

# Filter across multiple text columns
ai_jobs = eda.filter(
    F.col("SKILLS_NAME").rlike(pattern) |
    F.col("SPECIALIZED_SKILLS_NAME").rlike(pattern) |
    F.col("SOFTWARE_SKILLS_NAME").rlike(pattern) |
    F.col("COMMON_SKILLS_NAME").rlike(pattern) |
    F.col("LOT_OCCUPATION_NAME").rlike(pattern) |
    F.col("ONET_NAME").rlike(pattern)
)

ai_jobs.select("LOT_OCCUPATION_NAME", "SKILLS_NAME", "SALARY", "STATE_NAME").show(10, truncate=False)


‚úÖ Result:
You‚Äôll get a filtered DataFrame of job postings that likely relate to AI in some way ‚Äî either by title, skill, or software requirement.

üß© Step 4: Analyze or visualize

Now that you have ai_jobs, you can:

Count AI jobs by state or political affiliation:

ai_jobs.groupBy("AFFILIATION").count().show()


Compare AI salaries vs. non-AI:

ai_jobs.agg(F.avg("SALARY")).show()


See which industries (NAICS2) have the most AI postings:

ai_jobs.groupBy("NAICS2_NAME").count().orderBy(F.desc("count")).show()

ü™Ñ Optional: Create an AI flag column

If you plan to reuse this in future analysis:

eda = eda.withColumn(
    "IS_AI_JOB",
    (
        F.col("SKILLS_NAME").rlike(pattern) |
        F.col("SPECIALIZED_SKILLS_NAME").rlike(pattern) |
        F.col("SOFTWARE_SKILLS_NAME").rlike(pattern) |
        F.col("COMMON_SKILLS_NAME").rlike(pattern) |
        F.col("LOT_OCCUPATION_NAME").rlike(pattern) |
        F.col("ONET_NAME").rlike(pattern)
    ).cast("int")
)


Then you can do simple queries like:

eda.filter("IS_AI_JOB = 1").groupBy("AFFILIATION").agg(F.avg("SALARY")).show()


Would you like me to tailor that keyword list specifically for AI + data jobs (e.g., distinguishing between data analysis and genuine machine learning roles)?
That can make your filter far more precise.

















Input:
please write a code that provides data visualization with a side by side comparison of the count of job postings for each NAICS2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 

ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! We can create a side-by-side comparison of job posting counts across NAICS levels 2‚Äì6. Since you want counts by industry at each NAICS level, we can aggregate in PySpark and then use Plotly to make a grouped bar chart for each level.

Here‚Äôs a clean approach:

import plotly.express as px
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

# --- List of NAICS levels ---
naics_levels = ["NAICS2_NAME", "NAICS3_NAME", "NAICS4_NAME", "NAICS5_NAME", "NAICS6_NAME"]

# --- Aggregate counts for each NAICS level ---
counts_dfs = []
for level in naics_levels:
    df = (
        eda.groupBy(level)
           .agg(F.count("*").alias("count"))
           .withColumnRenamed(level, "Industry")
           .withColumn("NAICS_Level", F.lit(level))
    )
    counts_dfs.append(df)

# --- Combine all levels into a single DataFrame ---
combined_counts = counts_dfs[0]
for df in counts_dfs[1:]:
    combined_counts = combined_counts.union(df)

# Convert to Pandas for Plotly
combined_pd = combined_counts.toPandas()

# Optional: pick top 10 industries per NAICS level for clarity
combined_pd = combined_pd.groupby("NAICS_Level").apply(lambda x: x.nlargest(10, "count")).reset_index(drop=True)

# --- Plotly grouped bar chart ---
fig = px.bar(
    combined_pd,
    x="Industry",
    y="count",
    color="NAICS_Level",
    barmode="group",
    hover_data=["NAICS_Level", "count"],
    title="Job Posting Counts Across NAICS Levels 2‚Äì6",
    labels={"count": "Job Postings", "Industry": "Industry", "NAICS_Level": "NAICS Level"}
)

# Rotate x-axis labels for readability
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_tickangle=-45,
    yaxis_title="Number of Job Postings",
    xaxis_title="Industry",
    template="plotly_white",
    legend_title="NAICS Level"
)

fig.show()

‚úÖ What this does

Counts job postings for each NAICS2‚Äì6 level.

Combines them into a single DataFrame with a NAICS_Level column.

Plots a grouped bar chart with Plotly:

x-axis = Industry name

y-axis = Count of job postings

color = NAICS level

hover info = shows level and count.

Shows top 10 industries per level to prevent overcrowding.

If you want, I can also make a horizontal version where industries are on the y-axis ‚Äî it‚Äôs usually much cleaner for long names and multiple NAICS levels.

Do you want me to do that?
