In red states, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services has a slightly higher average salary. \n\n## Exploring the minimum education level by political affiliation\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"650\" src=\"./output/education_affiliation.html\" title=\"Min Education Levels by State Political Affiliation\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\nThis graph shows us the comparison of job postings by political affiliation and minimum education level. As you can see, red states have far more job postings for lower education levels such as High School, Associate Degree, or Bachelor's degree, and blue states have more postings requiring a Master's Degree or higher. \n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"650\" src=\"./output/salary_education_affiliation.html\" title=\"Average Salary by Min Education Levels and State Political Affiliation\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\nThis figure tells us that despite red states having more job postings with education level requirements below a Master's degree, the salaries in Blue states are higher for every single minimum education level. This could be attributed to a higher cost of living in most blue states. \n\n## AI Jobs Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"650\" src=\"./output/AI_education_affiliation.html\" title=\"AI Jobs by Min Education Levels and State Political Affiliation\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\nThis figure shows us the number of postings just with certain key words related to AI. It groups by education level and political affiliation. The graph tells us that the distribution of number of  AI job postings across education level and affiliation mirrors that of the larger data set. Thus, AI jobs are not posted at any higher frequency across red or blue states than any other job.\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"650\" src=\"./output/AI_salary_education_affiliation.html\" title=\"AI Job Salaries by Min Education Levels and State Political Affiliation\"></iframe>\n```\n\nSimilarly, in this figure, AI Jobs show salary distributions equivalent to that of jobs in other industries. Like the general analysis, blue states offer higher salaries for AI jobs across each of education levels. Again, this is likely due to the higher cost of living in most blue states. \n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"./output/AI_byState.html\" title=\"Number of AI Job Postings by State\"></iframe>\n```\n\nThis graph clearly shows that of the top 5 states with the most number of AI job postings, 4/5 of them are blue states. \n\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"./output/AI_industries.html\" title=\"Number of AI Job Postings by Industry\"></iframe>\n```\n\nThis graph is showing us the number of job postings by NAICS. For AI jobs, the NAICS with the largest number of AI job postings. Computer Systems Design is predominate NAICS with consulting services coming in second. \n\n",
