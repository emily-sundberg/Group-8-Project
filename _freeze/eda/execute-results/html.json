This analysis explores different facets of the data specifically related to the political affiliation of the states and the different job postings in each state. We also take a closer look at AI related jobs and the impact of political climate on salary. \n\n\n## Exploring the Salary by State Political Affiliation\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"650\" src=\"./output/salary_affiliation.html\" title=\"Salary By State Political Affiliation\"></iframe>\n```\n\nThis data clearly shows that average salaries are slightly higher in Blue states vs Red States across nearly all NAICS2 categories. In red states, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services has a slightly higher average salary. \n\n## Exploring the minimum education level by political affiliation\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"650\" src=\"./output/education_affiliation.html\" title=\"Min Education Levels by State Political Affiliation\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\nThis graph shows us the comparison of job postings by political affiliation and minimum education level. As you can see, red states have far more job postings for lower education levels such as High School, Associate Degree, or Bachelor's degree, and blue states have more postings requiring a Master's Degree or higher. \n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"650\" src=\"./output/salary_education_affiliation.html\" title=\"Average Salary by Min Education Levels and State Political Affiliation\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\nThis figure tells us that despite red states having more job postings with education level requirements below a Master's degree, the salaries in Blue states are higher for every single minimum education level. This could be attributed to a higher cost of living in most blue states. \n\n## AI Jobs Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"650\" src=\"./output/AI_education_affiliation.html\" title=\"AI Jobs by Min Education Levels and State Political Affiliation\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\nThis figure shows us the number of postings just with certain key words related to AI. It groups by education level and political affiliation. The graph tells us that the distribution of number of  AI job postings across education level and affiliation mirrors that of the larger data set. Thus, AI jobs are not posted at any higher frequency across red or blue states than any other job.\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"650\" src=\"./output/AI_salary_education_affiliation.html\" title=\"AI Job Salaries by Min Education Levels and State Political Affiliation\"></iframe>\n```\n\nSimilarly, in this figure, AI Jobs show salary distributions equivalent to that of jobs in other industries. Like the general analysis, blue states offer higher salaries for AI jobs across each of education levels. Again, this is likely due to the higher cost of living in most blue states. \n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"./output/AI_byState.html\" title=\"Number of AI Job Postings by State\"></iframe>\n```\n\nThis graph clearly shows that of the top 5 states with the most number of AI job postings, 4/5 of them are blue states. \n\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"./output/AI_industries.html\" title=\"Number of AI Job Postings by Industry\"></iframe>\n```\n\nThis graph is showing us the number of job postings by NAICS. For AI jobs, the NAICS with the largest number of AI job postings. Computer Systems Design is predominate NAICS with consulting services coming in second. \n\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"./output/gender_and_industry.html\" title=\"Industries With The Most Women vs Percent of Women in the Industry\"></iframe>\n```\n\nThe above graph has two different important features. First, it shows the top 10 industries for women on the bar chart, sorted by the overall number of women according the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics @bls2025cps. The second important feature is the line chart which shows the percentage of women in that field. As you can see, some of the most female dominated industries do not have very many women in them and some of the industries with the most women are heavily male dominated. \n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"./output/industry_gender_gap.html\" title=\"Industries with the Most Number of People vs the Number of Women in Those Industries\"></iframe>\n```\n\nThe above figure shows the top 10 industries with the most number of employed individuals based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics @bls2025cps. The blue bars show the number of people in those industries, and the red bars show the number of women in the industry. \n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"1500\" src=\"./output/ai_gender.html\" title=\"AI Industries and Female Representation\"></iframe>\n```\n\nThe above figure shows the representation of women in AI industries. It's worth noting that not a single one is female dominated, the highest female representation coming from Computer Systems Analysis with 43% female. The majority of these industries are less than 30% female. This displays a clear underrepresentation of females in AI industries. \n\n",
