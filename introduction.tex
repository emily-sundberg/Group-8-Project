\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}

We analyze gender disparities in hiring, AI participation, and wages
across U.S. industries and states, and situate these patterns in a
global context. Drawing on recent federal statistics Labor Statistics
((2025)), U.S. pay-gap trackers University Women ((2025a)); Women's
Policy Research ((2024)), and international reports Economic
Co-operation and Development ((2024)); Organization ((2023));
Organization ((2025)); Forum ((2025)), we find persistent occupational
segregation, widening U.S. annual earnings gaps since 2022, and
continued underrepresentation of women in AI-intensive roles.
State-level disparities correlate with policy environments such as
pay-transparency and salary-history bans University Women ((2025b)),
though industry composition and family structure are important
confounders. Conservative/market-based perspectives emphasize
occupational choice, hours, and career continuity as key mechanisms and
warn that some transparency policies may compress wages Institute
((2021)); Foundation ((2024)); Cullen and Pakzad-Hurson ((2021)); Cullen
((2023)); Mas ((2014)). We integrate both views and outline implications
for job seekers selecting sectors, geographies, and employers.

\section{Executive Summary}\label{executive-summary}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  U.S. employment remains gender-segregated: women ≈47\% of workers but
  overrepresented in health/education and underrepresented in
  construction, engineering, and many tech roles Labor Statistics
  ((2025)).
\item
  Every U.S. state has a pay gap; gaps tend to be smaller where
  transparency and equal-pay policies are stronger, though composition
  matters University Women ((2025b)).
\item
  U.S. annual earnings gap widened after 2022 (82.7¢ in 2023; ≈80.9¢ in
  2024 among full-time year-round), while hourly measures show
  \textasciitilde85\% in 2024 Women's Policy Research ((2024)); Center
  ((2025)).
\item
  Women remain 22--30\% of the global AI workforce and are more exposed
  to AI-driven task change in clerical/admin roles Economic Co-operation
  and Development ((2024)); Organization ((2023)); Organization
  ((2025)).
\item
  Globally, parity stands at 68.8\% and may take \textasciitilde123
  years at current pace Forum ((2025)).
\item
  Market-oriented analyses attribute much of the unadjusted gap to
  hours, occupation, and career continuity and note possible wage
  compression from transparency Institute ((2021)); Foundation ((2024));
  Cullen and Pakzad-Hurson ((2021)); Cullen ((2023)); Mas ((2014)).
\item
  Implications: build AI-complementary skills, target transparent
  employers and supportive states/metros, and use posted pay bands as
  inputs to evidence-based negotiation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Gender continues to shape labor-market outcomes in the United States and
worldwide. In 2024--2025, women's representation varies sharply across
industries, wage gaps persist, and AI both creates opportunities and
raises exposure risks. We examine four questions: (1) how hiring
patterns differ for men and women across industries; (2) whether
disparities vary between red and blue states; (3) whether women are more
underrepresented in AI fields; and (4) how wage gaps compare by gender
and political affiliations. We synthesize high-quality, recent
statistics and research to inform job-seeker strategy.

\section{Qualitative Research Method}\label{qualitative-research-method}

We triangulate multiple sources: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Current
Population Survey (CPS) 2024 annual averages for occupational
distributions Labor Statistics ((2025)); AAUW 2025 national and state
pay-gap indicators University Women ((2025a)); University Women
((2025b)); IWPR 2024 fact sheets on annual earnings gaps Women's Policy
Research ((2024)); Pew Research Center 2025 hourly pay-gap analysis
Center ((2025)); OECD 2024 policy brief on AI and women Economic
Co-operation and Development ((2024)); International Labour Organization
reports on generative-AI exposure (2023; 2025 update) Organization
((2023)); Organization ((2025)); and the WEF 2025 Global Gender Gap
Report Forum ((2025)). To incorporate conservative/market perspectives,
we review AEI and Heritage commentary Institute ((2021)); Foundation
((2024)) and research on equilibrium effects of pay transparency Cullen
and Pakzad-Hurson ((2021)); Cullen ((2023)); Mas ((2014)).

\section{Hiring Patterns Across Industries (U.S. and
Global)}\label{hiring-patterns-across-industries-u.s.-and-global}

U.S. employment remains gender-segregated. CPS 2024 annual averages
indicate women comprise roughly 47\% of total employment but are more
concentrated in health care, education, and service roles, with lower
shares in construction, engineering, and portions of tech Labor
Statistics ((2025)). Internationally, the World Economic Forum (2025)
estimates overall global gender parity at 68.8\%, with economic
participation parity at about 60--61\%, implying persistent
cross-country segmentation Forum ((2025)). Market-oriented analyses
argue that part of observed differences in outcomes reflect hours
worked, occupation mix, and career continuity rather than like-for-like
pay differences Institute ((2021)); Foundation ((2024)).

\section{State Politics and Gender Disparities (Red
vs.~Blue)}\label{state-politics-and-gender-disparities-red-vs.-blue}

AAUW's 2025 analysis shows that every U.S. state has a gender pay gap,
with substantial dispersion across states University Women ((2025b)).
Cross-state differences correlate with policy adoption such as
salary-history bans and pay-transparency requirements, which are more
prevalent in many blue states University Women ((2025b)). However,
composition matters: industry mix (e.g., energy and construction),
unionization, urbanization, and childcare access vary across states and
can generate red--blue patterns without ideology being the sole driver.
Earlier peer-reviewed work associates state liberalism with narrower
gaps, but causality remains difficult to establish Maume ((2015)).
Recent reporting suggests that post-pandemic return-to-office mandates
have reduced flexibility and may contribute to widening national gaps,
though these effects likely differ by state and sector Post ((2025)).

\section{Women in AI Fields (U.S. \& Global) and Political
Context}\label{women-in-ai-fields-u.s.-global-and-political-context}

Women remain underrepresented in AI and tech roles. The OECD documents
lower female representation in AI-exposed professional occupations and
constrained access to AI tools Economic Co-operation and Development
((2024)). The ILO shows that clerical and administrative
tasks---female-heavy---are highly exposed to generative-AI
transformation in high-income countries; a 2025 refinement confirms the
asymmetric exposure Organization ((2023)); Organization ((2025)). Direct
state-by-state measures of female AI participation are limited. It is
therefore premature to assert causality from political ideology to AI
underrepresentation without merging employer-level AI job postings and
hires with state policy and industry controls. Nonetheless, differences
in STEM pipelines, childcare, higher education, and transparency regimes
plausibly contribute to cross-state variation Organization ((2023));
Organization ((2025)); Economic Co-operation and Development ((2024)).

\section{Wage Gaps and Political
Affiliation}\label{wage-gaps-and-political-affiliation}

On annual full-time, year-round earnings, IWPR reports a deterioration
from 2022 to 2023 (82.7¢) and news coverage indicates about 80.9¢ in
2024---the lowest since 2016 Women's Policy Research ((2024)); Newsweek
((2025)). By contrast, Pew Research Center's hourly series shows women
earned about 85\% of men's hourly pay in 2024 when combining full- and
part-time workers Center ((2025)). Adjusted gaps shrink after
controlling for occupation, hours, and experience but do not disappear
Institute ((2021)); Center ((2025)). Policy can narrow gaps:
pay-transparency laws are associated with smaller within-firm gaps but
may compress overall wages or slow wage growth according to equilibrium
analyses Cullen and Pakzad-Hurson ((2021)); Cullen ((2023)); Mas
((2014)).

\section{Implications for Job Seekers
(2025)}\label{implications-for-job-seekers-2025}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Sector choice:} Target underrepresented, higher-growth fields
  such as data, AI, and engineering while building verifiable skills,
  certifications, and portfolios Labor Statistics ((2025)); Economic
  Co-operation and Development ((2024)).
\item
  \textbf{Geography:} Favor states and metros with pay-transparency
  requirements and supportive care infrastructure while benchmarking
  offers with state snapshots University Women ((2025b)).
\item
  \textbf{AI resilience:} Develop AI-complementary skills to hedge
  exposure in clerical/admin roles and to compete for AI-adjacent,
  higher-pay tracks Organization ((2023)); Economic Co-operation and
  Development ((2024)).
\item
  \textbf{Employer screening:} Prefer organizations with posted pay
  bands, career-progression transparency, and flexible/hybrid policies
  as RTO mandates may widen disparities Post ((2025)).
\item
  \textbf{Negotiation:} Use posted ranges as inputs, not anchors, and
  negotiate based on documented contributions; be aware of
  transparency's potential compression effects Cullen and Pakzad-Hurson
  ((2021)); Cullen ((2023)); Mas ((2014)).
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations}\label{limitations}

Causal attribution of political ideology to gender disparities is
challenging due to confounding by industry mix, demographics, and local
cost structures. AI participation statistics with state-gender
granularity remain sparse. International comparisons depend on differing
definitions of occupations, pay, and employment. Transparency policy
effects vary by market and occupation; equilibrium responses may offset
some intended benefits.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Gender disparities in hiring, AI participation, and pay persist across
the U.S. and globally. State policies and employer practices shape
observed gaps, but composition and choice also matter. A pragmatic
job-search strategy in 2025 combines sector targeting, AI-adjacent
upskilling, careful geography selection, and screening for transparent,
flexible employers. Continuous measurement using CPS updates, AAUW/IWPR
dashboards, and international benchmarks will be essential for tracking
progress.
